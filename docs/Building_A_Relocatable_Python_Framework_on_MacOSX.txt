# Before building remember to rename /Applications/Python 3.4.app to save it and replace it afterwards
# as the damn python installation from source always overwrites it no matter the configure prefix used

# now build Python 3.4.3 as a framework
# Need to patch Python-3.4.3.tgz to allow it to build Mac OS X 10.9 compliant 
# build under Mac OS X 10.10

# use pip3 to install all other required python packages to its site-packages

# Now a complete Python.framework has been built in ${MYDEST}
# But we still need to make it a relocatable framework

# To make it relocatable we need to use otool and install_name_tool to change
# the dylib name and path to it from all executables in the Python.framework

# A Quick Guide: On Mac OS X, one may use:
#     "otool -D <file>" to view the install name of a dylib
#     "otool -L <file>" to view the dependencies
#     "otool -l <file> | grep LC_RPATH -A2" to view the RPATHs
#     "install_name_tool -id ..." to change an install name
#     "install_name_tool -change ..." to change the dependencies
#     "install_name_tool -rpath ... -add_rpath ... -delete_rpath ..." to change RPATHs
 
# Make the framework's main dylib relocatable using rpath

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/
sudo chmod u+w Python
otool -D ./Python
sudo install_name_tool -id @rpath/Python ./Python

# Change the dependencies of the executable files in bin to point to the relocatable 
# framework in a relative way and add the proper rpath to find the Python (renamed dylib)

cd bin
sudo install_name_tool -change ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/Python @rpath/Python python3.4
sudo install_name_tool -change ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/Python @rpath/Python python3.4m
sudo install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path/../ ./python3.4

# now do the same for the Python.app stored inside the Python.framework Resources 
# This app is needed to allow gui use by python for plugins

cd ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS
sudo install_name_tool -change ${MYDEST}/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/Python @rpath/Python ./Python
sudo install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path/../../../../ ./Python

# We should now have a fully relocatable Python.framework ready to use to build and 
# bundle into Sigil
